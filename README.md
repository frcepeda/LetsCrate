LetsCrate
---------

This is an unofficial command line client for [Let's Crate](http://letscrate.com) written in Ruby.

Please let me know what you think! You can reach me at frcepeda AT gmail DOT com

Quick start manual
------------------

To use this program, you need to create an account at [Let's Crate](http://letscrate.com).

Every command needs the "-l" switch, with the username and password separated by a
colon.

Example: 

    -l username:password  
    -l "username:password"
    
After that, you can select an action from the list below and use the command normally.

You can use multiple files, names or crates in the commands whose explanations
are in plural.

If you use the --regexp function with the commands marked with an asterisk, every argument
will be treated as a regular expression. The search option uses regular expressions
by default.

An ID is a 5 digit identifier used internally by Let's Crate. 
To know the ID of your files, use the "-a" option to list them with their respective URLs and IDs.  
Generally, you don't need to know the ID of a file, but if you do, you can use it
instead of the name of the files/crates (it's faster).
