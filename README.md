**Whoops, Let's Crate seems to be acting up a bit. I'm getting 502 errors whenever I try
to connect with their [API](http://letscrate.com/api). Can someone confirm this for me?
Authentication seems to pass through, but I get the error afterwards.**

**To check if it works for you, use the -t option like this: `letscrate.rb -l username:password -t`. 
It'll tell you if something's wrong.**

LetsCrate
=========

This is an unofficial command line client for [Let's Crate](http://letscrate.com) written in Ruby.

Please let me know what you think! You can reach me at <frcepeda@gmail.com>.

Quick start manual
==================

To use this program, you need to create an account at [Let's Crate](http://letscrate.com) and
to install Typhoeus. You can do that with `gem install typhoeus`.

**Every command needs the "-l" switch**, with the username and password separated by a
colon.

Example: 

    -l username:password  
    -l "username:password"
    
After that, you can select an action from the list below and use the command normally.

You can use multiple files, names or crates in the commands whose descriptions
are in plural.

If you use the --regexp function with the commands marked with an asterisk, every argument
will be treated as a regular expression. The search and the list options use regular expressions
by default.

Tips
====

Login information
-----------------

To avoid having to type your credentials every time you want to run this command, make an alias
in your .bashrc file with something like this:

`alias letscrate = "/path/to/letscrate.rb -l 'username:password'"`

IDs
---

An ID is a 5 digit identifier used internally by Let's Crate. 
To know the ID of your files, use the "--ids" option to list them with their respective
URLs and IDs when executing any command.

For example, you can list all your crates and files with their IDs by typing
`letscrate.rb -l username:password -a --ids`

Generally, you don't need to know the ID of a file, but if you do, you can use it
instead of the name of the files/crates (it's faster).

**You can also mix names with IDs whenever you want to.**

If for some reason one of your files or crates is named with a 5 digit number, to stop
this program from treating it as an ID, suffix it with a '$' (e.g. "34982$" will be treated as
a name instead of an ID).

String Handling
---------------

You can type only a fragment of a crate or file's name if you know it's unique. Even if you
don't specify the --regexp option, the program internally uses *case insensitive* regular
expressions. For example, you can type only "yell" if one of your crates/files is called
"Yellow.zip" and you know none of the other ones have that exact string in them.

In the off chance that two names collide (e.g. "apple" and "apples with pears"), you can add
a '$' to the end of the shorter one ("apple$").

What is a regular expression?
-------------------------------

You can read about 
[regular expressions in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

TO DO
=====

* Use a configuration file to avoid typing the login credentials each time the command is run.

Bugs
====

* None yet, but please open a ticket (or email me) if you find one.

Quirky stuff
============

* Let's Crate just added password verification for files (it was previously Crate only), 
which renders this application useless for downloading them. You can still upload, delete and
list them, but you can't download them unless you use your browser.
