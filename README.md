To know the ID of your files, use the "-a" option to list them with their
respective URLs and IDs.

TO DO
-----

* Add file searching
* Allow using filenames where IDs are required
* Implement checks on files and IDs to see if they're valid
* Output more informative error messages
* Fix formatting errors with long filenames
