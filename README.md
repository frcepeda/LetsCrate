An ID is a 5 digit identifier used internally by LetsCrate.
To know the ID of your files, use the "-a" option to list them with their
respective URLs and IDs.
You can also use regular expressions whenever a name is required (currently only the search option).

TO DO
-----

* Allow using filenames where IDs are required
